<h1>Homework 7: Choropleth and proportional symbol map</h1>
<h2>Madeline Scott</h2>
<h3>This map shows two different metrics of the effects of hurricanes. The choropleth displays property damage in thousands of US dollars. The proportional symbol map portrays deaths to humans caused by tornadoes. Although the property damage was missing for some states, we can see a general trend of higher property damage costs occurring alongside higher fatality counts. Data comes from NOAAâ€™s National Weather Service site and contains information from 2005-2007.
